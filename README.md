# PDGA DATA

PDGA Data project is to crawl, process, analyze and display data found from PDGA.com. The goal is to provide easily searchable data that provides more insight about players, tournaments and the whole player base.

PDGA does not provide the best analytical data on their own website which is why this project was created.
