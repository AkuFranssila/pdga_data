#Upload all players once
#Async crawl/update players? #TODO
#What happens next time player is updated?
  #What fields to update? We don't want to remove PDGA rating if player goes inactive
  #How to track which fields were updated? New collection or field to check what was updated
  #
#Different process for download players and uploading them to mongodb
  #Update needs to be done/could be done once a week. PDGA numbers update once a month
  #Need to do checks what fields to update, if player plays new tournament, if rating changes, if player status changes
